    <p>Hey there my name is <span className="text-2xl font-semibold">Reynold Osei Adade</span></p>
    <p>I have been coding for a while and I am now a lead developer, I always wanted to create a portfolio page but
      since I have always been busy with work I never got the chance to do so. I am glad I finally got the chance to do so.
    </p>
    <p>I was actually thinking pretty much alot about what goes into a portfolio page?</p>
    <p>For a lead after so many years working on enterprise apps what exactly can you show?</p>
    <p>So i decided to just use this chance to work on real world scenarios we may encounter when we work on big projects and 
      the best ways to go about it and some technologies I may use</p>
   </div>
